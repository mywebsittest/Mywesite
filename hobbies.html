    <h1>These are some of my hobbies and interest.</h1>
    <h2>Swimming</h2>
    <p>I love swimming and while i was young, my elder brother could take me to the beach <br> with him and encouraged me to learn swimming.Then in 2015 i joined swimming club while at my secondary school. Swimming has always been fun <br> since i last won the swimming competition in Akii Bua Stadium Lira District.</p>

<h2>Gymnastics</h2>
<p class="3">I also love physical exercise that entails running, frog-jumping and weight-lifting objects. <br> my leisure time i always ensure that i spend two hours jogging to keep fit. At times i go for mountain climbing that seems exhaustive and nerve cracking.</p>
